## Summary
I have a great desire to become a developer. At the moment I have a small amount of knowledge, but I will do my best to become a professional.
I started studying a couple of months ago: I read literature, watch videos from developers, and also take courses on the HTML Academy portal (I bought a subscription to understand in detail the profession of Front-end developer).

I hope I succeed :)
